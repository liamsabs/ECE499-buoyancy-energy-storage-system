For regen braking

Set this to 0 because we don't want this to just be a diode for all PWMS
    /* PWM1H Output Port Enable bit
       1 = PWM Generator controls the PWM1H output pin
       0 = PWM Generator does not control the PWM1H output pin */
    PG1IOCONHbits.PENH = 1;

Then just set the pin to 1

PWM frequency determines ADC sample rate since PWM 1 triggers ADC conversion. When conversion finishes the interrupt takes place.
